# List_Adapter_DiffUtils
In Android development, a ListAdapter is a subclass of RecyclerView.Adapter designed to simplify the process of working with lists or grids of data within a RecyclerView. It was introduced as part of the Android Jetpack library to streamline the implementation of RecyclerViews and to handle updates to the underlying data set efficiently.
